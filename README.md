# euchre

Welcome to Euchre!

Game rules can be found at https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/euchre/

Prompts should guide you well through the game. 

If you are having trouble entering a suit/value to play, make sure you are typing it as it appears. (suits are plural, numbers are entered as numbers, and bowers are right_bower). Capitlization does not matter

Future editions will have:
-ability to go alone for a hand
-will show who is currently winning each trick
-AI players!
